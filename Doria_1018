Question: Descirbe process of file recovery.

Answer: You will have to xxd the disk with the designated file in it, then you will have to find the header of that extension of the
file using grep. Then you will have to note the big number before the colon, search the footer of that file using grep, and then get
the first number again. Next using the program that calculates hex numbers, subtract the two numbers by each other and get the file
size. You lastly make a dd of this.
